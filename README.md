## Local / Remote Execution sequence steps

1 - Export your environment variables to be used by terraform
``` sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[your access ID ]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[your secret key]
```

2- Execute pre run in which all files are going to be merged
``` sh
python3 automation/cicd/terrraform-pre-run.py
```

3- Execute terraform initialization command
``` sh
terraform init ./terraform
```

4- Execute terraform plan command
``` sh
terraform plan ./terraform
```

5- Execute terraform plan command
``` sh
terraform apply ./terraform
```
## Coding standards and naming conventions

* Read carefully names used in AWS LZ and try to follow the same convention. 
* Modules has to represent a module in our application. 
* Modules promotes reusability and are part of building pattern if you think that your module cannot be part of a module or your module will not be generic enough please discuss first doing any implementation of it.
* Modules with submodules is allowed but make sure if that module has to be tied with main module and not be part of more generic / common service if more than one module use it.
* Each template must have a header with a reference of what is instantiating in that block of code and it dependencies.
* Inner modules variables generic because can be used in differents intantiations
* Outter variables uses by templates must to be very specific to make reference to what is being store on them.
* Module required variables must match with Provider API values not provided can be default.
* All resources in which provider accept tags must follow our tagging convention 
* Naming for resouces in modules are the following
    ``` 
    aws_lz_[module]
    aws_lz_[sub-element]
    aws_lz_[sub-element]_[custom implementation]
    ```
* Naming for module instance is more specific to give context of it using 
    ```
        module "aws_lz_organizations_ou_core" {
    ```
* Tags conventions must to be provided in all AWS element that support them. 
    * **ProjectID**    Project ID
    * **Environment**  Environment in which that componets was created
    * **AccountID**    Account ID
    * **Key Name**     Key name to identify that item in the cloud 

    _Make sure to respect names and case_
